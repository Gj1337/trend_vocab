This app helps users improve their vocabulary for the IELTS Academic Writing section. It presents a quiz where users are shown a picture and must choose the correct word from four options. After selecting an answer, the correct choice is revealed along with examples of how the word is used in context. Additionally, each phrase is pronounced by voice, allowing users to practice both recognition and pronunciation. This feature helps strengthen vocabulary recall and prepares users for the writing test. Check the app by link ðŸ‘‰ [TrendVocab](https://gj1337.github.io/trend_vocab/)
